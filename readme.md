# DSA Problem Solutions in C++

Welcome to my repository of solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. These solutions are implemented using **C++ (C++23)** and cover a wide range of topics to help understand and solve algorithmic challenges.

## Features

- **Language:** All solutions are written in **C++**, utilizing modern features from **C++23** for efficiency and readability.
- **Topics Covered:** The repository includes problems on:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees and Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Sorting and Searching
  - Backtracking
  - Other advanced topics
---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the solutions, you need a C++ compiler that supports **C++23**. For example:
- **GCC:** Version 13 or later
- **Clang:** Version 16 or later
- **MSVC:** Build tools with support for C++23


## Problem List

Each problem file includes:
- The problem statement (or a link to the problem description).
- Approach and time complexity analysis.
- The solution in C++.
